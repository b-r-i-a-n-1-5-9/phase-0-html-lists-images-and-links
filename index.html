    <!-- When we want to include an image to our website, we will use an image tag -->
    <!-- An image tag is writen this way <img> and it does not have a closing tag. this means that everything about the image should be enclosed in the tag-->
    <!-- for example-->
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600.png" alt="alternative test incase the image fails to load"
        tittle=" display title" width="800" height="600" />
    <!-- lets now learn more about links-->
    <a href="https://lightsalmon-crocodile-892002.builder-preview.com/"> Crosstour Africa </a>
    <!-- in the situation where we want to make an image clickable rather than text, in the place where we would have placed the text, we ought to place an image tag. for example-->
    <a href="https://lightsalmon-crocodile-892002.builder-preview.com/"> <img
            src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600.png" alt=" Crosstours website page" /> </a>
    <!-- Remember, it is also posible to create a clickable email link-->
    <!-- to create one, we just follow the same process but in the contect section, we just include an email-->
    <a href="mailto:briangarang@gmail.com"> For more information on tour packages, kindly email the organisation at </a>
    <!-- There are situations where we might want to link a specific location on the same page. the first step would be create an id element, and then retrieve the information using the specified id element.-->
